The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\INVI\INVI-SMS_ALERT - Copy_10_MAY\New Folder\invi-sms alert.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\INVI\INVI-SMS_ALERT - Copy_10_MAY\New Folder\Support\invi-sms alert.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
